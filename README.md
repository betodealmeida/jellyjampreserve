# JellyJamPreserve

JellyJamPreserve is a Raspberry Pi project that uses the [Jack Timemachine](http://plugin.org.uk/timemachine/) to record audio on the click of button (or toggle of a switch). It continuously records audio into a 5 minute circular buffer, and when the button is clicked the buffer is dumped to a file and it starts recording audio to the file until the button is clicked again. This way you can preserve any cool improvisations by recording **sounds from the past**!
